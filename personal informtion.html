          <p class="p2"> I live in the town of Beita in Palestine. I study at An-Najah University in Nablus, where I am pursuing my academic goals. Alongside my studies, I work privately in the field of mirror painting, which I find to be a creative way to express myself. Additionally, I have a passion for programming and enjoy learning and developing my skills in this field, as it opens new horizons and allows me to engage with modern technologies.</p>
